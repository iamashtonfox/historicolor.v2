## Historicolor.v2 is a solo version of historicolor developed by yours truly
### The first historicolor was a bit messy and unfunctional so I wanted to use this as a chance to recreate it + challenge myself

Documentation (for myself): https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-thief-react

The API to fetch the colors needed for a given artwork needs to be installed for the game to function; run "npm i -S color-thief-react" in the top directory.
After that, run 'npm start dev' to run locally.

Might deploy when it reaches a state I'd call finished, might not. We'll see.

On the larger feature to-do list:

-finish basic implementation
-add game difficulties
-implement a scoreboard
-add option to guess by rgb values
-add how-to-play tutorial/help box
