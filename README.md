## Historicolor.v2 is a solo version of historicolor developed by yours truly
### The first historicolor was a bit messy and unfunctional so I wanted to use this as a chance to recreate it + expand my expertise

There are no special dependencies needed, just run 'npm start dev' to run locally. Might deploy when it reaches a state I'd call finished, might not. We'll see.
